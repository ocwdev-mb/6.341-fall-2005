  caption: The compact disc (CD) still remains the standard playback format for commercial
    audio recordings. Audio CDs consist of stereo tracks stored using 16-bit pulse-code
    modulation and coded at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. Recording and playback of
    the CD utilize many of the digital signal processing techniques discussed in this
    course. (Image courtesy of Darren Hester \[PPDigital\].)
